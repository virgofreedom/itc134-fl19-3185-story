A long, long time ago in a squidgy, squidgy galaxy...
After leaving the feathery planet Earth, a group of teens fly toward a distant speck. The speck gradually resolves into a stripey, space heights.

Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Albert Barlow, a frantic giant capable of adultery and even kidnap.
